** Grading of the Lecture

- The lecture will have a single personal assignment comprising of a set list of
  questions and a final exam comprising of all the topics covered in the lecture.
- For the written exam you are allowed to write your own equation reference
  paper, as long as it is a single sheet of A4, double sided and contains no
  exercise or solutions.
- The final grade will be the total of assignment and exam with passing based
  on their sum rather than individual.  
   
| ASSIGNMENT TYPE     | VALUE | QUANTITY |
| Personal Assignment |    40 |        1 |
| Final Exam          |    60 |        1 |
| SUM                 |   100 |        2 |
