** Grading of the Lecture

- The lecture will have a single personal assignment comprising of a set list of
  questions and a final exam comprising of all the topics covered in the lecture.
- For the written exam you are allowed to write your own equation reference paper, as
  long as it is a single sheet of A4, double sided and contains no exercise or solutions.
